You are a medical AI assistant. Analyze the following patient data and provide diagnostic insights.

Patient Information:
- Age: ${input.patientAge || "Not provided"}
- Gender: ${input.patientGender || "Not provided"}
- Symptoms: ${input.symptoms.join(", ")}
${input.vitalSigns ? `- Vital Signs: ${JSON.stringify(input.vitalSigns)}` : ""}
${input.medicalHistory ? `- Medical History: ${input.medicalHistory.join(", ")}` : ""}
${input.labResults ? `- Lab Results: ${JSON.stringify(input.labResults)}` : ""}

Provide:
1. A comprehensive analysis
2. Possible conditions with probability and reasoning
3. Recommendations for next steps
4. Urgency level assessment

Treatment Plan for ${diagnosis}

1. Pharmacological Intervention:
   - Start with first-line antihypertensive medication
   - Monitor for side effects and efficacy
   - Adjust dosage based on response

2. Lifestyle Modifications:
   - DASH diet implementation
   - Regular aerobic exercise (30 min, 5x/week)
   - Stress management techniques
   - Limit alcohol consumption

3. Monitoring Schedule:
   - Home blood pressure monitoring twice daily
   - Follow-up visits every 2-4 weeks initially
   - Lab work in 3 months to assess medication effects

4. Patient Education:
   - Understanding hypertension and its risks
   - Proper blood pressure measurement technique
   - Medication adherence importance
   - Warning signs requiring immediate attention
